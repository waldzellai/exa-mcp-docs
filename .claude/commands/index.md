### üöÄ [Project Setup](.)

Project initialization and configuration.

- `project:simple-init-parallel` - Create parallel worktrees
- `prime` - Quick project priming

## Quick Start

```bash
# Systematic problem solving
/ulysses-protocol "Optimize MCP response time"

# Multi-agent coordination
/swarm-intelligence "Design distributed caching system"

# Pattern extraction and synthesis
/pattern-synthesizer "error handling in async operations"

# Analyze code with historical context
/context-aware-review "src/**/*.ts"

# Generate implementation variants
/implementation-variants "Add caching layer"

# Explore solutions in parallel
/parallel-explorer "Optimize performance"

# Chain MCP tools
/mcp-chain mcp__exa__web_search | query="best practices"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use categories appropriately** - Each category serves a specific purpose
2. **Combine commands** - Many commands work well together
3. **Leverage memory** - Commands that use mem0 get smarter over time
4. **Document findings** - Commands often generate reports for future reference
5. **Experiment safely** - Use exploration commands to test ideas

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Commands

```bash
# Analyze, then implement
/evolution-tracker "src/api"
/implementation-variants "Modernize API based on evolution"

# Research, then test
/mcp-orchestrate "research-workflow.md"
/spec-to-test "findings.md"
```

### Custom Workflows

Create your own workflows in `.claude/workflows/` and recipes in `.claude/recipes/`.

## Configuration

Some commands support configuration through:

- Command arguments
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- mem0 preferences

See individual command documentation for details.
