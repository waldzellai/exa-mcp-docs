# Adaptive Workflow

Self-modifying workflows that adapt their execution strategy based on intermediate results and changing conditions.

## Command Structure

```bash
/adaptive-workflow "<workflow_description>" [--adaptation=<type>] [--learning=<mode>] [--monitoring=<frequency>] [--constraints=<limits>]
```

## Parameters

- `workflow_description`: Description of the adaptive workflow to create
- `adaptation`: Adaptation type (reactive, predictive, learning, hybrid)
- `learning`: Learning mode (online, offline, transfer, meta)
- `monitoring`: Monitoring frequency (continuous, periodic, event-driven, threshold)
- `constraints`: Constraint limits (time, resources, quality, cost)

## Adaptation Types

### Reactive Adaptation
- Respond to immediate changes
- Adjust execution based on current state
- Handle unexpected conditions
- Optimize for current context

### Predictive Adaptation
- Anticipate future conditions
- Proactively adjust workflow
- Use historical patterns
- Optimize for predicted scenarios

### Learning Adaptation
- Learn from execution patterns
- Improve adaptation strategies
- Build predictive models

### Hybrid Adaptation
- Combine multiple adaptation types
- Context-sensitive adaptation selection
- Multi-layer adaptation strategies
- Optimal for complex scenarios

## Learning Modes

### Online Learning
- Learn during workflow execution
- Adapt in real-time

### Offline Learning
- Learn from historical data
- Batch strategy updates
- Comprehensive pattern analysis
- Optimal for stable environments

### Transfer Learning
- Apply learning across workflows
- Leverage existing knowledge
- Accelerate adaptation
- Optimal for similar contexts

### Meta-Learning
- Learn how to adapt better

- Improve learning efficiency
- Optimal for diverse scenarios

## Integration with Command System

```bash
# Adaptive development workflow
/adaptive-workflow "Implement feature with quality gates" --adaptation=learning --monitoring=continuous

# Adaptive debugging workflow
/adaptive-workflow "Debug complex distributed issue" --adaptation=reactive --learning=online

# Adaptive research workflow
/adaptive-workflow "Research emerging technology" --adaptation=predictive --learning=transfer

# Adaptive deployment workflow
/adaptive-workflow "Deploy with progressive rollout" --adaptation=hybrid --monitoring=event-driven
```

## Workflow Adaptation Strategies

### Execution Path Adaptation
- Modify workflow steps based on results
- Skip unnecessary steps
- Add additional validation steps
- Optimize execution sequence

### Resource Allocation Adaptation
- Adjust resource usage based on demand
- Reallocate resources dynamically
- Optimize for efficiency
- Handle resource constraints

### Quality Threshold Adaptation
- Adjust quality gates based on context
- Modify acceptance criteria
- Optimize for time vs. quality trade-offs
- Handle changing requirements

### Strategy Selection Adaptation
- Choose optimal strategies based on context
- Switch between different approaches
- Combine multiple strategies
- Optimize for specific conditions

## Output Artifacts

### Adaptive Workflow Definition
- Base workflow structure
- Adaptation rules and triggers
- Learning mechanisms
- Monitoring and feedback loops

### Execution History
- Workflow adaptation decisions
- Performance metrics over time
- Learning outcomes
- Strategy effectiveness analysis

### Adaptation Models
- Learned adaptation patterns
- Predictive models

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Adaptation Triggers**: Define when and how to adapt
2. **Bounded Adaptation**: Set limits on adaptation extent
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Implement comprehensive monitoring
4. **Learning Validation**: Validate learning outcomes
5. **Fallback Strategies**: Have fallback options for adaptation failures

## Example Usage

```bash
# Adaptive CI/CD pipeline
/adaptive-workflow "Deploy with adaptive testing" --adaptation=learning --monitoring=continuous --constraints=time

# Adaptive code review process
/adaptive-workflow "Review with dynamic quality gates" --adaptation=reactive --learning=online

# Adaptive research and development
/adaptive-workflow "Explore solution space adaptively" --adaptation=predictive --learning=transfer

# Adaptive incident response
/adaptive-workflow "Respond to production issues" --adaptation=hybrid --monitoring=event-driven
```

## Monitoring and Feedback

### Performance Monitoring
