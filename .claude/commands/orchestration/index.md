# Orchestration Commands

Advanced coordination and multi-agent intelligence for complex problem solving.

## Available Commands

### [swarm-intelligence](./swarm-intelligence.md)

Deploy specialized AI agents across multiple contexts to solve complex multi-dimensional problems through autonomous coordination, hierarchical command, or peer-to-peer networks.

### [meta-orchestrator](./meta-orchestrator.md) _(Coming Soon)_

Higher-order orchestration that coordinates multiple swarms and traditional workflows based on problem complexity analysis.

### [adaptive-workflow](./adaptive-workflow.md) _(Coming Soon)_

Self-modifying workflows that adapt their execution strategy based on intermediate results and changing conditions.

## When to Use Orchestration

### Complex Problems Requiring Multiple Perspectives

- System architecture decisions
- Technology migration planning
- Performance optimization across multiple dimensions
- Security and compliance analysis

### Unknown Solution Space

- Research and development projects
- Innovation exploration
- Competitive analysis
- Future-proofing strategies

### Cross-Domain Expertise Required

- Full-stack implementation
- DevOps and infrastructure
- Business logic and UX
- Performance and security

## Integration with Other Command Categories

### With Analysis Commands

- Use swarm for comprehensive system analysis
- Parallel execution of multiple analysis approaches
- Cross-validation of findings

### With Development Commands

- Multiple implementation strategies
- Parallel testing of different approaches
- Quality assurance across variants

### With Workflow Commands

- Orchestrate complex MCP tool chains
- Coordinate multiple workflow executions
- Adaptive workflow selection

## Example Coordination Patterns

```bash
# Complex system design
/swarm-intelligence "Design microservices architecture for evaluation system"

# Multi-dimensional optimization
/swarm-intelligence "Optimize performance while maintaining security and usability"

# Research and implementation
/swarm-intelligence "Explore and implement advanced caching strategies"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Mission Definition**: Be specific about goals and constraints
2. **Agent Specialization**: Let agents focus on their strengths
3. **Coordination Mode Selection**: Choose based on problem complexity
4. **Result Synthesis**: Integrate findings coherently
5. **Learning Integration**: Capture patterns for future missions
