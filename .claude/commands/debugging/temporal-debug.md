# Temporal Debug

Debug time-sensitive issues using historical data, timing analysis, and state machine reconstruction.

## Command Structure

```bash
/temporal-debug "<issue_description>" [--time-range=<range>] [--frequency=<freq>] [--state-machine=<sm>] [--correlation=<type>]
```

## Parameters

- `issue_description`: Description of the time-sensitive issue
- `time-range`: Time range for analysis (e.g., "1h", "24h", "7d")
- `frequency`: Sampling frequency for analysis (e.g., "1s", "1m", "5m")
- `state-machine`: State machine to reconstruct (if applicable)
- `correlation`: Temporal correlation type (periodic, trending, event-driven, cyclic)

## Temporal Debugging Approach

### Timeline Reconstruction
- Reconstruct sequence of events over time
- Identify temporal patterns and anomalies
- Correlate events across different time scales
- Map cause-and-effect relationships

### State Machine Analysis
- Reconstruct state transitions over time
- Identify invalid or unexpected state changes
- Analyze state consistency across time
- Detect timing-dependent state issues

### Timing Analysis
- Measure timing intervals and durations
- Identify timing violations and constraints
- Analyze temporal dependencies
- Detect race conditions and deadlocks

### Historical Pattern Analysis
- Identify recurring temporal patterns
- Analyze seasonal and cyclical behaviors
- Compare current behavior to historical baselines
- Detect trend changes and anomalies

## Temporal Debugging Strategies

### Time-Series Analysis
- Analyze metrics and logs over time
- Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Correlate different time series
- Detect temporal dependencies

### Event Correlation
- Correlate events across time windows
- Identify event sequences and patterns
- Analyze event timing and frequency
- Detect missing or delayed events

### State Transition Analysis
- Track state changes over time
- Identify invalid state transitions
- Analyze state persistence and consistency
- Detect timing-dependent state issues

### Performance Regression Analysis
- Compare performance over time periods
- Identify performance degradation patterns
- Correlate performance with external factors
- Detect timing-related performance issues

## Integration with Other Commands

```bash
# Use time machine for historical context
/time-machine "performance-metrics" --point-in-time="before-regression"
/temporal-debug "Performance degradation over time" --time-range="7d"

# Combine with systematic debugging
/systematic-debug "Intermittent failures" --context=temporal
/temporal-debug "Race condition analysis" --frequency="1ms" --correlation=event-driven

# Use with distributed debugging for timing issues
/distributed-debug "Cross-service timing issues" --correlation=timing
/temporal-debug "Distributed transaction timeouts" --time-range="1h" --correlation=periodic
```
