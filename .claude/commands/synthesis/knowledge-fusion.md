## Integration Strategies

### Convergent Synthesis
Multiple sources pointing to similar conclusions:
- **Confidence Amplification**: High-confidence insights
- **Best Practice Identification**: Proven approaches
- **Standard Pattern Recognition**: Widely-adopted solutions
- **Risk Mitigation**: Well-understood failure modes

### Divergent Synthesis
Sources providing different perspectives:
- **Context Dependency Analysis**: When different approaches apply
- **Innovation Opportunity Identification**: Unexplored combinations
- **Nuanced Understanding**: Complex, multi-faceted insights
- **Creative Solution Generation**: Novel synthesis possibilities

### Complementary Synthesis
Sources filling different pieces of the puzzle:
- **Holistic Understanding**: Complete picture construction
- **Gap Filling**: Inference and logical completion
- **Multi-Scale Integration**: From implementation to strategy
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Different perspective integration

## Validation Mechanisms

### Cross-Source Validation
- **Triangulation**: Verify insights across multiple sources

    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "concept_id_1",
      "target": "concept_id_2",
      "type": "dependency|composition|evolution",
      "strength": 0.8,
      "context": "when this relationship applies"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Decision Framework
```yaml
framework:
  name: "Decision Framework Name"
  context: "When to use this framework"
  
  criteria:
    - name: "Evaluation Criterion"
      weight: 0.3
      measures: "What this criterion evaluates"
      
  options:
    - name: "Option Name"
      scores: {criterion1: 0.8, criterion2: 0.6}
      trade_offs: "Key trade-offs and considerations"
      
  recommendations:
    - condition: "When this applies"
      action: "Recommended action"
      confidence: 0.9
```

## Best Practices

1. **Multi-Source Requirement**: Always fuse from at least 3 different source types
2. **Conflict Acknowledgment**: Explicitly identify and address contradictions
3. **Confidence Tracking**: Maintain confidence levels throughout synthesis
4. **Context Preservation**: Keep contextual applicability clear
5. **Validation Integration**: Build validation into the fusion process
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve synthesis based on feedback
