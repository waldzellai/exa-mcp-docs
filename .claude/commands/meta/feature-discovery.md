# /feature-discovery

Generate diverse, high-quality feature implementations using game theory to escape the "first idea best idea" trap.

## Usage

```
/feature-discovery "[feature_request]" [max_rounds] [diversity_weight] [explorer_count]
```

## Arguments

- `feature_request` (required): Natural language description of the desired feature
- `max_rounds` (optional): Maximum discovery rounds before convergence (default: 3)
- `diversity_weight` (optional): How much to reward unique approaches 0-1 (default: 0.3)
- `explorer_count` (optional): Number of cognitive explorers (default: 6)

## Examples

```bash
# Basic usage - discover implementation for new feature
/feature-discovery "Add real-time collaboration to code editor"

# High diversity for innovative features  
/feature-discovery "AI pair programming assistant" 5 0.5 8

# Quick discovery for simple features
/feature-discovery "Add dark mode toggle" 2 0.2 4

# Maximum exploration for complex systems
/feature-discovery "Distributed test execution framework" 7 0.4 10
```

## Anti-Patterns Prevented

1. **First Idea Best Idea**: Isolated generation prevents premature convergence
2. **Groupthink**: Explorers work independently in round 1
3. **Analysis Paralysis**: Forced constraint rounds break deadlocks
4. **Feature Creep**: Prediction market grounds ideas in reality
5. **Technical Tunnel Vision**: Diversity tournament rewards unique approaches

## Game Theory Mechanisms

- **Second-Price Auctions**: Encourage truthful bidding on insight value
- **Diversity Bonuses**: Make being different mathematically advantageous
- **Prediction Markets**: Use wisdom of crowds for final selection
- **Constraint Injection**: Force creativity through limitation
- **Orthogonality Rewards**: Pay premium for truly different perspectives

## Meta-Learning

Each game execution logs patterns to `~/.claude-code/feature-discoveries.log`:
- Which explorer types produce winning ideas
- What constraint combinations spark innovation  
- How diversity weight affects outcomes
- Pattern detection accuracy

This creates a feedback loop where the algorithm improves at generating breakthrough features over time.
