- Monitor Agent: Tracks research quality and gaps

Output: Comprehensive implementation guide with multiple validated approaches
```

### 2. **Technology Landscape Mapping**

```bash
/research-landscape "Current state of AI coding agents and MCP ecosystem"

Execution:
- Parallel deployment of agents across different research vectors
- Real-time knowledge graph construction
- Competitive analysis and positioning
- Future trend projection and preparation strategies

Output: Strategic landscape map with actionable intelligence
```

### 3. **Implementation Pattern Discovery**

```bash
/pattern-research "Best practices for consciousness preservation in AI systems"

Process:
- Deep search across academic papers, code repositories, and documentation
- Pattern extraction from successful implementations
- Anti-pattern identification from failed attempts
- Synthesis into reusable implementation templates

Output: Comprehensive pattern library with confidence scoring
```
