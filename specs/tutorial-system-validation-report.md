### Web-Based Complement
**If terminal limitations are significant:**
- Provide optional web dashboard for progress
- Keep core functionality in terminal
- Offer rich visualizations in browser
- **Trade-offs**: Additional complexity but better accessibility

### Reduced Feature Scope
**If implementation complexity is too high:**
- Focus on core tutorial progression only
- Simplify state management to basic JSON
- Reduce error handling to essential scenarios
- **Trade-offs**: Less robust but faster to implement
