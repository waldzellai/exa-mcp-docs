**Open the enrichment modal**

Use the chat: you can add enrichments by prompting directly in the Chat! Or click on “Add Enrichment” in the top-right corner.

**Fill in your prompt:** Prompt the AI generator to have our agent fill in the fields for you, or fill in the enrichment type, title and prompt directly. **Enrichment types:** text, contact information (email & phone number), date, number, options (think of these as tags!)

Cool examples of enrichments:

*   “Find me this candidate’s contact information” - Contact
*   “Do a sentiment analysis on each article” - Text or Options
*   “Categorize these companies by B2B or B2C” - Options
*   “Create a custom email based on this company’s main product”- Text
*   “Give me this candidate’s years of experience” - Number
*   “Find any public data on this company’s revenue or valuation” - Text
*   “What is the most powerful data point mentioned in each research paper?” - Text
