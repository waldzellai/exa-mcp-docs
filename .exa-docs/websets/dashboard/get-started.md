Websets is very easy to use. ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/websets/websets-landing.png)

1.  Describe what you want in plain English - make it as complicated as you’d like!

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/websets/websets-preview.png)

2.  Confirm your criteria and data category look good.

3\. Inside your Webset

In brief, Websets does the following:

1.  Break down what you’re asking for
2.  Find promising data that might satisfy your ask
3.  Verify all criteria using AI agents and finding parallel sources
4.  Adjust search based on feedback you provide our agent

If you’re not satisfied with the initial results you see, refine the criteria in “Edit criteria” or inside the chat.

Once the Webset is complete, you can interact with the components! Click on a result to see: ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/websets/websets-result.png)

1.  Its AI-generated summary
2.  The criteria it met to be included in the Webset
3.  The sources that informed the matching (you can click through the sources here)

You can manually delete results, to clean up your Webset before exporting it.

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/websets/add-enrichment.png)

*   The name of the column (e.g. ‘Revenue’)
*   The column type (e.g. ‘Number’)
*   Instructions for Websets to find the data (e.g. ‘Find the annual revenue of the company’)
