In this example, we will build an LLM-based news summarizer with the Exa API to keep us up-to-date with the latest news on a given topic. We’ll do this in three steps:

1.  Generate search queries for Exa using an LLM
2.  Retrieve relevant URLs and their contents using Exa
3.  Summarize webpage contents using GPT-3.5 Turbo

This is a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), combining Exa’s search capabilities with GPT’s summarization abilities.

The Jupyter notebook for this tutorial is available on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uZ0kxFCWmCqozl3ArTJohNpRbeEYlwlT?usp=sharing) for easy experimentation. You can also [check it out on Github](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-py/tree/master/examples/newssummarizer/summarizer.ipynb), including a [plain Python version](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-py/tree/master/examples/newssummarizer/summarizer.py) if you want to skip to the complete product.

](#get-started)

Get Started

1

Pre-requisites and installation

Install the required packages:

Copy

Ask AI

```
pip install exa_py openai
```

You’ll need both an Exa API key and an OpenAI API key to run this example. You can get your OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

[

## Get your Exa API key





](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)

Set up your API keys:

Copy

Ask AI

```
from google.colab import userdata # comment this out if you're not using Colab

EXA_API_KEY = userdata.get('EXA_API_KEY') # replace with your Exa API key
OPENAI_API_KEY = userdata.get('OPENAI_API_KEY') # replace with your OpenAI API key
```

2

Initialize the clients

Import and set up both the OpenAI and Exa clients:

Copy

Ask AI

```
import openai
from exa_py import Exa

openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
exa = Exa(EXA_API_KEY)
```

3

Generate a search query

First, we’ll use GPT to generate an optimized search query based on the user’s question:

Copy

Ask AI

```
SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "You are a helpful assistant that generates search queries based on user questions. Only generate one search query."
USER_QUESTION = "What's the recent news in physics this week?"

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_MESSAGE},
        {"role": "user", "content": USER_QUESTION},
    ],
)

search_query = completion.choices[0].message.content

print("Search query:")
print(search_query)
```

4

Search for recent articles

Now we’ll use Exa to search for recent articles, filtering by publication date:

Copy

Ask AI

```
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

one_week_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7))
date_cutoff = one_week_ago.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

search_response = exa.search_and_contents(
    search_query, start_published_date=date_cutoff
)

urls = [result.url for result in search_response.results]
print("URLs:")
for url in urls:
    print(url)
```

We use `start_published_date` to filter for recent content.

5

Get article contents

Exa’s `search_and_contents` already retrieved the article contents for us, so we can access them directly:

Copy

Ask AI

```
results = search_response.results
result_item = results[0]
print(f"{len(results)} items total, printing the first one:")
print(result_item.text)
```

Unlike traditional search engines that only return URLs, Exa gives us direct access to the webpage contents, eliminating the need for web scraping.

6

Generate a summary

Finally, we’ll use GPT to create a concise summary of the article:

Copy

Ask AI

```
import textwrap

SYSTEM_MESSAGE = "You are a helpful assistant that briefly summarizes the content of a webpage. Summarize the users input."

completion = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_MESSAGE},
        {"role": "user", "content": result_item.text},
    ],
)

summary = completion.choices[0].message.content

print(f"Summary for {urls[0]}:")
print(result_item.title)
print(textwrap.fill(summary, 80))
```

And we’re done! We’ve built an app that translates a question into a search query, uses Exa to search for useful links and their contents, and summarizes the content to effortlessly answer questions about the latest news.

**Through Exa, we have given our LLM access to the entire Internet.** The possibilities are endless.
