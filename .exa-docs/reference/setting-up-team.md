Exa organizes account usage and paid feature access through ‘Teams’: Upon account creation, you’re placed in a ‘Personal’ Team. You can use the dropdown in the top-left of the Exa dashboard shown below to create a new Team or select between other Teams you have. You can make as many Teams as you like.

Inviting people to your team

Team admins can add members via the Invite feature in Team settings. ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/ac51b5b-Screenshot_2024-07-14_at_18.57.50.png) Once a team member is invited, their status will be ‘Pending’ on the team management menu. ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/291cf4a-Screenshot_2024-07-14_at_18.59.29.png) They will receive an email inviting them to join the team. ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/5168c00-Screenshot_2024-07-08_at_21.01.10.png) Once accepted, you’ll see both members are ‘Accepted’. All Team members share the usage limits and features of their respective Team’s plan. ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/exa-52/images/858e63a-Screenshot_2024-07-14_at_19.01.19.png)
