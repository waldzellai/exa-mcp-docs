LlamaIndex is a framework for building LLM applications powered by structured data. In this guide, we’ll use Exa’s LlamaIndex integration to:

1.  Specify Exa’s Search and Retrieve Highlight Tool as a LlamaIndex retriever
2.  Set up an OpenAI Agent that uses this tool in its response generation

* * *

](#get-started)

Get Started

1

Pre-requisites and installation

Install the llama-index, llama-index core, llama-index-tools-exa libraries. OpenAI dependencies are within the core library, so we don’t need to specify that.

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```
pip install llama-index llama-index-core llama-index-tools-exa
```

Also ensure API keys are initialized properly. The following code uses the `EXA_API_KEY` as the relevant environment variable name.[

## Get your Exa API key





](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)

2

Instantiate Exa tool

Import the relevant Exa integration library and instantiate LlamaIndex’s `ExaToolSpec`.

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```
from llama_index.tools.exa import ExaToolSpec
import os

exa_tool = ExaToolSpec(
    api_key=os.environ["EXA_API_KEY"],
)
```

3

Choose the Exa method to use

For this example, we are only interested in passing the [search\_and\_retrieve\_highlights](search) method to our agent, so we specify this using the `.to_tool_list`LlamaIndex method. We also pass `current_date`, a simple utility so our agent knows the current date.

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```
print('Tools that are provide by Exa LlamdaIndex integration:')
print('\n'.join(map(str, (exa_tool.spec_functions))))

search_and_retrieve_highlights_tool = exa_tool.to_tool_list(
    spec_functions=["search_and_retrieve_highlights", "current_date"]
)
```

4

Set up an OpenAI Agent and make Exa-powered requests

Set up the [OpenAIAgent](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/Chatbot%5FSEC/), passing the filtered down toolset from above.

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```
from llama_index.agent.openai import OpenAIAgent

agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(
    search_and_retrieve_highlights_tool,
    verbose=True,
)
```

We can then use the chat method to interact with the agent.

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```
agent.chat(
    "Can you summarize the news from the last month related to the US stock market?"
)
```

5
