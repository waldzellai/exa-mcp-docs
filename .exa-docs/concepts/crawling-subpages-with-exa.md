You can also check it out on Github, including a plain Python version if you want to skip to a complete product.\nTo play with this code, first we need a Exa API key and an OpenAI API key.

We will use GPT 3.5-turbo as our LLM. Let&#39;s ask it for the recent news, like we might ask ChatGPT.\n  import openai\nopenai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY\nUSER_QUESTION = &#34;What&#39;s the recent news in physics this week?&#34;\ncompletion = openai.chat.completions.create(\nmodel=&#34;gpt-3.5-turbo&#34;,\nmessages=[\n{&#34;role&#34;: &#34;system&#34;, &#34;content&#34;: &#34;You are a helpful assistant.&#34;},\n{&#34;role&#34;: &#34;user&#34;, &#34;content&#34;: USER_QUESTION},\n],\n)\nresponse = completion.choices[0].message.content\nprint(response)\n  \n One recent news in physics is that researchers at the University of Illinois have discovered a new topological state of matter. They created a material composed of interacting particles called quadrupoles, which can exhibit unique behavior in their electrical properties. This finding has the potential to pave the way for the development of new types of electronic devices and quantum computers.\nAnother interesting development is in the field of cosmology. The European Space Agency&#39;s Planck satellite has provided new insights into the early universe. By analyzing the cosmic microwave background radiation, scientists have obtained more accurate measurements of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which could challenge current theories of physics.\nAdditionally, scientists at CERN&#39;s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have observed a rare phenomenon called charm mixing. They found that particles containing both charm and strange quarks can spontaneously transition between their matter and antimatter states. This discovery could contribute to our understanding of the puzzle of why the universe is primarily made of matter and why there is very little antimatter.\n \nOh no! Since the LLM is unable to use recent data, it doesn&#39;t know the latest news. It might tell us some information, but that info isn&#39;t recent, and we can&#39;t be sure it&#39;s trustworthy either since it has no source. Luckily, Exa API allows us to solve these problems by connecting our LLM app to the internet. Here&#39;s how:\nLet&#39;s use the Exa neural search engine to search the web for relevant links to the user&#39;s question.\nFirst, we ask the LLM to generate a search engine query based on the question.\n  import openai\nfrom exa_py import Exa\nopenai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY\nexa = Exa(EXA_API_KEY)\nSYSTEM_MESSAGE = &#34;You are a helpful assistant that generates search queries based on user questions.

Now let&#39;s put the search query into Exa. Let&#39;s also use start_published_date to filter the results to pages published in the last week:\n  from datetime import datetime, timedelta\none_week_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7))\ndate_cutoff = one_week_ago.strftime(&#34;%Y-%m-%d&#34;)\nsearch_response = exa.search_and_contents(\nsearch_query, use_autoprompt=True, start_published_date=date_cutoff\n)\nurls = [result.url for result in search_response.results]\nprint(&#34;URLs:&#34;)\nfor url in urls:\nprint(url)\n  \n URLs:\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-01-carrots-reveals-mechanics-root-vegetable.html?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=v2\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-01-astrophysicists-theoretical-proof-traversable-wormholes.html\nhttps://gizmodo.com/proton-physics-strong-force-quarks-measurement-1851192840\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/24/science/space/black-holes-photography-m87.html\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-01-liquid-lithium-walls-fusion-device.html?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=v2\nhttps://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s13\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-01-validating-hypothesis-complex.html?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=v2\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-01-scientists-previously-unknown-colonies-emperor.html?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=v2\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-01-reveals-quantum-topological-potential-material.html?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=v2\nhttps://phys.org/news/2024-01-shallow-soda-lakes-cradles-life.html?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=v2\n \nNow we&#39;re getting somewhere! Exa gave our app a list of relevant, useful URLs based on the original question.\nBy the way, we might be wondering what makes Exa special. Why can&#39;t we just search with Google? Well, let&#39;s take a look for ourselves at the Google search results. It gives us the front page of lots of news aggregators, but not the news articles themselves. And since we used Exa&#39;s search_and_contents, our search came with the webpage contents, so can use Exa to skip writing a web crawler and access the knowledge directly!\n  results = search_response.results\nresult_item = results[0]\nprint(f&#34;{len(results)} items total, printing the first one:&#34;)\nprint(result_item.text)\n  \n 10 items total, printing the first one:\nCredit: CC0 Public Domain\nChopped carrot pieces are among the most universally enjoyed foods and a snacking staple‚Äîa mainstay of school lunchboxes, picnics and party platters year-round.\nNow researchers from the University of Bath have uncovered the secret science of prepping the popular root vegetable and quantified the processes that make them curl up if left uneaten for too long.\nMechanical Engineering student Nguyen Vo-Bui carried out the research as part of his final-year studies, in the limited circumstances of COVID-19 lockdowns of 2021. The research paper, &#34;Modelling of longitudinally cut carrot curling induced by the vascular cylinder-cortex interference pressure&#34;, is published in Royal Society Open Science.\nWithout access to labs, Nguyen aimed to identify the geometrical and environmental factors that have the most influence on carrots&#39; longevity. Working in his kitchen, he characterized, analytically modeled and verified the aging of over 100 Lancashire Nantes carrot halves, cut lengthways, using finite-element (FE) models normally used in structural engineering.\nThe research team concluded that residual stresses and dehydration were the two key factors behind the curling behavior. The starchy outer layer of the carrot (the cortex) is stiffer than the soft central vein (also known as the vascular cylinder). When cut lengthwise, the two carrot halves curl because the difference in stress becomes unbalanced. Dehydration leads to further loss of stiffness, further driving the curling effect.\nTheir recommendations to manufacturers include handling carrots in cold, moist, airtight and humidity-controlled environments to protect their natural properties and increase their edible life span.\nThey say the study provides a methodology to predict the deformation of cut root vegetables, adding that the procedure is likely to apply to other plant structures. The study gives food producers a new mathematical tool that could be applied to the design of packaging and food handling processes, potentially reducing food waste.\nOne of the world&#39;s top crops by market value, carrots are known for their high production efficiency‚Äîbut despite this, wastage is high. Around 25‚Äì30% of this occurs prior to processing and packaging‚Äîdue to deformities, mechanical damage or infected sections. Fresh cut and minimally processed carrots are a convenient ready-to-use ingredient that make possible the use of carrots that might otherwise be discarded, reducing food waste.\nDr. Elise Pegg, a senior lecturer in Bath&#39;s Department of Mechanical Engineering, is one of the research paper authors and oversaw the study. She said, &#34;We have mathematically represented the curl of a cut carrot over time, and showed the factors that contribute to curling.\n&#34;Our motivation was to look for ways to improve the sustainability of carrot processing and make them as long-lasting as possible. We have produced a methodology that a food producer could use to change their processes, reducing food waste and making packaging and transportation more efficient. Understanding the bending behavior in such systems can help us to design and manufacture products with higher durability.\n&#34;A question like this would normally be investigated from a biological perspective, but we have done this work using purely mechanical principles. I&#39;m so pleased for Nguyen‚Äîit&#39;s a measure of his resourcefulness and dedication to produce such interesting research in a challenging situation.&#34;\nOver the course of a week, the curl of the carrot halves increased‚Äîwith the average radius of each carrot&#39;s curvature falling from 1.61m to 1.1m. A 1.32-times reduction in stiffness was also seen, correlating with the carrots drying out; on average, their weight fell by 22%.\nNguyen added, &#34;This was interesting research‚Äîto apply mechanical principles to vegetables was surprising and fun.\n&#34;One of the big challenges was to devise an experiment that could be done in a lockdown setting, without access to normal labs and equipment. To now be in a position to have this work published in an academic journal and potentially be used by the food industry is really rewarding.\n&#34;This project has inspired me to continue my studies at the University of Bath and I now study residual stresses in porous ferroelectric ceramics for my Ph.D.&#34;\nAs well as having to use a suitcase to collect the 30kg of carrots the experiment demanded from a farmers&#39; market, a further challenge was finding ways to use them afterward. Carrot cake, the Indian carrot dessert Gajar Ka Halwa, carrot pesto and many other dishes kept Nguyen and his flatmates fed for several days.\nMore information:\nModelling of longitudinally cut carrot curling induced by the vascular cylinder-cortex interference pressure, Royal Society Open Science (2024).

Carrots\nare a highly produced crop, but wastage is still high, with a significant amount\noccurring before processing and packaging. The study was carried out by\nMechanical Engineering student Nguyen Vo-Bui during the COVID-19 lockdowns of\n2021.\n \nAnd we&#39;re done! We built an app that translates a question into a search query, uses Exa to search for useful links, uses Exa to grab clean content from those links, and summarizes the content to effortlessly answer your question about the latest news, or whatever we want.\nWe can be sure that the information is fresh, we have the source in front of us, and we did all this with a Exa queries and LLM calls, no web scraping or crawling needed!\n With Exa, we have empowered our LLM application with the Internet.

Unfortunately, googling ‚Äúcompanies similar to Thrifthouse‚Äù doesn&#39;t do a very good job. Traditional search engines rely heavily on keyword matching. In this case we get results about physical thrift stores. Hm, that&#39;s not really what I want.\nLet‚Äôs try again, this time searching based on a description of the company, like by googling ‚Äúcommunity based resale apps.‚Äù But, this isn‚Äôt very helpful either and just returns premade listicles...\n      What we really need is neural search.\nExa is a fully neural search engine built using a foundational embeddings model trained for webpage retrieval. It‚Äôs capable of understanding entity types (company, blog post, Github repo), descriptors (funny, scholastic, authoritative), and any other semantic qualities inside of a query. Neural search can be far more useful for these types of complex queries.\nLet&#39;s try Exa, using the Python SDK!

Now let&#39;s starting building Exa Researcher. The app should be able to automatically generate research reports for all kinds of different topics. Here&#39;s two to start:\n  const SAMA_TOPIC = &#39;Sam Altman&#39;;\nconst ART_TOPIC = &#39;renaissance art&#39;;\n  \nThe first thing our app has to do is decide what kind of search to do for the given topic. \nExa offers two kinds of search: neural and keyword search. Here&#39;s how we decide:\nNeural search is preferred when the query is broad and complex because it lets us retrieve high quality, semantically relevant data. Neural search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans. \nKeyword search is useful when the topic is specific, local or obscure. If the query is a specific person&#39;s name, and identifier, or acronym, such that relevant results will contain the query itself, keyword search may do well. And if the machine learning model doesn&#39;t know about the topic, but relevant documents can be found by directly matching the search query, keyword search may be necessary.\nSo, Exa Researcher is going to get a query, and it needs to automatically decide whether to use keyword or neural search to research the query based on the criteria. Sounds like a job for the LLM! But we need to write a prompt that tells it about the difference between keyword and neural search-- oh wait, we have a perfectly good explanation right there.\n  // Let&#39;s generalize the prompt and call the search types (1) and (2) in case the LLM is sensitive to the names. We can replace them with different names programmatically to see what works best.\nconst SEARCH_TYPE_EXPLANATION = `- (1) search is usually preferred when the query is a broad topic or semantically complex because it lets us retrieve high quality, semantically relevant data. (1) search is especially suitable when a topic is well-known and popularly discussed on the Internet, allowing the machine learning model to retrieve contents which are more likely recommended by real humans.\n- (2) search is useful when the topic is specific, local or obscure. If the query is a specific person&#39;s name, and identifier, or acronym, such that relevant results will contain the query itself, (2) search may do well. And if the machine learning model doesn&#39;t know about the topic, but relevant documents can be found by directly matching the search query, (2) search may be necessary.\n`;\n  \nHere&#39;s a function that instructs the LLM to choose between the search types and give its answer in a single word. Based on its choice, we return keyword or neural.\n  async function decideSearchType(topic, choiceNames = [&#39;neural&#39;, &#39;keyword&#39;]){\nlet userMessage = &#39;Decide whether to use (1) or (2) search for the provided research topic.

Now we have to craft some search queries for the topic and the search type. There are two cases here: keyword search and neural search. Let&#39;s do the easy one first.

This is tougher: you can read all about crafting good Exa searches here. But this is actually a really good thing: making the perfect Exa search is hard because Exa is so powerful! Exa allows us to express so much more nuance in our searches and gives us unparalleled ability to steer our search queries towards our real objective.\nWe need to our app to understand our goal, what Exa is, and how to use it to achieve the goal. So let&#39;s just tell the LLM everything it needs to know.\n  function createNeuralQueryGenerationPrompt(topic, n){\nreturn `I&#39;m writing a research report on ${topic} and need help coming up with Exa keyword search queries.\nExa is a fully neural search engine that uses an embeddings based approach to search. Exa was trained on how people refer to content on the internet. The model is trained given the description to predict the link. For example, if someone tweets &#34;This is an amazing, scientific article about Roman architecture: &lt;link&gt;&#34;, then our model is trained given the description to predict the link, and it is able to beautifully and super strongly learn associations between descriptions and the nature of the content (style, tone, entity type, etc) after being trained on many many examples. Because Exa was trained on examples of how people talk about links on the Internet, the actual Exa queries must actually be formed as if they are content recommendations that someone would make on the Internet where a highly relevant link would naturally follow the recommendation, such as the example shown above.\nExa neural search queries should be phrased like a person on the Internet indicating a webpage to a friend by describing its contents.

It is known for combining the advancements in technique with the exploration of deeper layers of meaning in artworks. In Renaissance paintings, the identification of the patron or donor often provides insights into the intended message of the artwork. For example, a painting discussed in an article from the Royal Academy[^1] was commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, the Bishop of Paphos on the island of Cyprus, and was likely painted by Titian during his early twenties. Analyzing the patronage and symbolism in Renaissance paintings allows for a better understanding of the multifaceted meanings conveyed by the artists.\nAnother key aspect of studying Renaissance art is understanding the contexts and environments in which art is encountered and viewed. The influence of the viewer&#39;s point of view and focal point plays a critical role in shaping the experience of art. Lectures provided by Wondrium[^3] discuss the importance of first impressions and explore how the artist positions the viewer with respect to the image. Additionally, the genres of Western art and the artist&#39;s media, tools, and techniques are explored in these lectures, providing a comprehensive understanding of the various elements that contribute to the creation and perception of Renaissance art.\nOverall, studying Renaissance art encompasses an exploration of not only the technical skills and innovations of the artists but also the cultural and historical contexts in which the artworks were created. By analyzing the patronage, symbolism, and viewing experience, researchers gain a deeper appreciation and interpretation of this significant period in the history of art.\nReferences:\n[1] How to Read a Renaissance Painting.

However, research published Monday in Nature and PLoS Genetics has provided the first comprehensive look at the genetic origins of their incredible wings.But to appreciate the genetics of their wing development, it‚Äôs important to know how crazy a bat in flight truly\\xa0looks.Try a little experiment: Stick your arms out to the side, palms facing forward, thumbs pointing up toward the ceiling. Now imagine that your fingers are\\xa0long, arching down toward the floor like impossibly unkempt fingernails ‚Äî but still made of bone, sturdy and spread apart. Picture the sides of your body connecting to your hands, a rubbery membrane attaching your leg and torso to those long fingers, binding you with strong, stretchy skin. Then, finally, imagine using your muscles to flap those enormous hands.Bats, man.As marvelous as bat flight is to behold, the genetic origins of their storied wings has remained murky. However, new findings from an international team of researchers led by Nadav Ahituv, PhD, of the University of California at San Francisco, Nicola Illing, PhD, of the University of Cape Town\\xa0in\\xa0South Africa\\xa0and Katie Pollard, PhD of the UCSF-affiliated Gladstone Institutes has shed new light on how, 50 million years ago, bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs and went up into the sky.Using a sophisticated set of genetic tools, researchers approached the question of how bats evolved flight by looking not only at which genes were used in the embryonic development of wings, but at what point during development the genes were turned on and off, and ‚Äî critically ‚Äî what elements in the genome were regulating the expression of these genes. Genes do not just turn themselves on without input; genetic switches, called enhancers, act to regulate the timing and levels of gene expression in the body.&#39;,\n&#34;Since flight evolved millions of years ago in all of the groups that are capable of flight today, we can&#39;t observe the changes in behavior and much of the morphology that the evolution of flight involves. We do have the fossil record, though, and it is fairly good for the three main groups that evolved true flight. We&#39;ll spare you an in-depth description of how each group evolved flight for now; see the later exhibits for a description of each group and how they developed flight.&#34;,\n&#34;It&#39;s easy to forget that one in five species of mammal on this planet have wings capable of delivering spectacularly acrobatic flying abilities. Equally incredibly, two-thirds of these 1,200 species of flying mammal can fly in the dark, using exquisite echolocation to avoid obstacles and snatch airborne prey with stunning deftness. These amazing feats have helped make bats the focus not only of folkloric fascination, but also of biological enquiry and mimicry by human engineers from Leonardo da Vinci onwards. Recent research in PLOS journals continues to add surprising new findings to what we know about bats, and how they might inspire us to engineer manmade machines such as drones to emulate their skills. Bats, unlike most birds and flying insects, have relatively heavy wings ‚Äì something that might appear disadvantageous. But a recent study in PLOS Biology by Kenny Breuer and colleagues shows that bats can exploit the inertia of the wings to make sharp turns that would be near-impossible using aerodynamic forces alone. The authors combined high-speed film of real bats landing upside-down on ceiling roosts with computational modelling to tease apart aerodynamic and inertial effects.&#34;],\n[&#34;things, gold and silver, could buy a victory. And this Other Italian cities, inspired by Rome&#39;s example, overpowered occupying troops, shut their gates again and invited a second siege. Hannibal could not punish them without dividing his he had no competent leadership to do so, what with one member of&#34;,\n&#39;A group of Celts known as the Senone was led through Italy by their commander, Brennus. The Senone Gauls were threatening the nearby town of Clusium, when Roman Ambassadors from the Fabii family were sent to negotiate peace for Clusium. The Romans were notoriously aggressive, and so it is only a little surprising that when a scuffle broke out between the Gauls and Clusians, the Fabii joined in and actually killed a Senone chieftain. The Roman people voted to decide the fate of those who broke the sacred conduct of ambassadors, but the Fabii were so popular that they were instead voted to some of the highest positions in Rome. This absolutely infuriated Brennus and his people and they abandoned everything and headed straight for Rome. Rome was woefully unprepared for this sudden attack. The Gauls had marched with purpose, declaring to all the towns they passed that they would not harm them, they were heading straight for Rome.&#39;,\n&#34;Hannibal had no intention to sit and recieve the romans in spain.Hannibal clearly considered the nature of roman power-and came to the conclusion that Rome could only be defeated in Italy.The cornerstone of Rome&#39;s power was a strategic manpower base that in theory could produce 7,00,000 infantry and 70,000 cavalry.More than half of this manpower base (4,00,000) was provided by rome&#39;s Italian allies,who paid no taxes but had to render military service to rome&#39;s armies.Not all were content.Carthage on the other hand rarely used its own citizens for war,bulk of its army being mercenaries.In any case its manpower could never even come close to Rome,the fact that had aided roman victory in the 1st Punic war.Hannibal thus understood that Rome could afford to raise and send army after army to spain and take losses. Meanwhile any carthiginian losses in spain would encourage the recently conquered iberian tribes to defect. The only way to defeat Rome,was to fight in italy itself.By winning battle after battle on italian soil and demonstrating to the italian allies rome&#39;s inability to protect them and weakness,he could encourage them to break free of Rome eroding Rome&#39;s manpower to sizeable proportions. But there was one problem,his fleet was tiny and Rome ruled the seas.By land,the coastal route would be blocked by Roman forces and her ally-the great walled city of massalia.Hannibal thus resolved to think and do the impossible - move thousands of miles by land through the pyranees mountains,uncharted territory inhabited by the fierce gauls ,then through the Alps mountains and invade italy. Even before the siege of Saguntum had concluded,Hannibal had set things in motion.Having sent a number of embassies to the Gallic tribes in the Po valley with the mission of establishing a safe place for Hannibal to debouch from the Alps into the Po valley. He did not desire to cross this rugged mountain chain and to descend into the Po valley with exhausted troops only to have to fight a battle.Additionally the fierce gauls would provide a source of manpower for Hannibal&#39;s army.The romans had recently conquered much territory from the gauls in this area,brutally subjagating them ,seizing their land and redistributing it to roman colonists.Thus securing an alliance proved to be easy. After the sack of Saguntum he dismissed his troops to their own localities.&#34;]]\n \nNow, let&#39;s give the context we got to our LLM so it can answer our questions with solid sources backing them up!\n  responses = []\nfor question, info in zip(questions, info_for_llm):\nsystem_prompt = &#34;You are RAG researcher.

An international team of researchers used genetic tools to study the &#39;\n&#39;embryonic development of bat wings and the genes involved in their &#39;\n&#39;formation. They also investigated the regulatory elements in the genome that &#39;\n&#39;control the expression of these genes. By analyzing these factors, the &#39;\n&#39;researchers discovered that bats took a tetrapod blueprint for arms and legs &#39;\n&#39;and adapted it to develop wings, allowing them to fly. This research &#39;\n&#39;provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of bat wings &#39;\n&#39;and how they evolved over 50 million years ago.\\n&#39;\n&#39; &#39;,\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39; Question: How did Rome defend Italy from Hannibal?\\n&#39;\n&#39; Answer: Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by using various strategies. One &#39;\n&#39;of the main defenses relied on the Roman manpower base, which consisted of a &#39;\n&#39;large army made up of Roman citizens and Italian allies who were obligated &#39;\n&#34;to render military service. Rome&#39;s strategic manpower base was a cornerstone &#34;\n&#39;of their power, as it could produce a significant number of infantry and &#39;\n&#39;cavalry. This posed a challenge for Hannibal, as Carthage relied heavily on &#39;\n&#34;mercenaries and could not match Rome&#39;s manpower.\\n&#34;\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39;Hannibal realized that in order to defeat Rome, he needed to fight them in &#39;\n&#39;Italy itself. His plan was to win battles on Italian soil and demonstrate &#39;\n&#34;Rome&#39;s inability to protect their Italian allies, with the intention of &#34;\n&#34;encouraging them to break free from Rome. This would erode Rome&#39;s manpower &#34;\n&#39;base to a sizeable proportion. However, Hannibal faced several obstacles. &#39;\n&#39;Rome ruled the seas, making it difficult for him to transport troops and &#39;\n&#39;supplies by sea. Additionally, the coastal route to Italy would be blocked &#39;\n&#39;by Roman forces and their ally, the walled city of Massalia.\\n&#39;\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39;To overcome these challenges, Hannibal devised a daring plan. He decided to &#39;\n&#39;lead his troops on a treacherous journey through the Pyrenees mountains, &#39;\n&#39;inhabited by fierce Gauls, and then through the Alps mountains to invade &#39;\n&#39;Italy. He sent embassies to Gallic tribes in the Po valley, securing &#39;\n&#39;alliances and establishing a safe place for his army to enter the Po valley &#39;\n&#39;from the Alps.\\n&#39;\n&#39;\\n&#39;\n&#39;Overall, Rome defended Italy from Hannibal by leveraging their manpower &#39;\n&#39;base, their control of the seas, and their strategic alliances with Italian &#39;\n&#39;allies. They also had the advantage of better infrastructure and control &#39;\n&#39;over resources within Italy itself. These factors ultimately played a &#39;\n&#34;significant role in Rome&#39;s defense against Hannibal&#39;s invasion.\\n&#34;\n&#39; &#39;]\n \nExa can be used for more than simple question answering. One superpower of embeddings-based search is that we can search for the meaning of sentences or even paragraphs:\n  paragraph = &#34;&#34;&#34;\nGeorgism, also known as Geoism, is an economic philosophy and ideology named after the American\npolitical economist Henry George (1839‚Äì1897).This doctrine advocates for the societal collective,\nrather than individual property owners, to capture the economic value derived from land and other\nural resources. To this end, Georgism proposes a single tax on the unimproved value of land, known\nas a &#34;land value tax,&#34; asserting that this would deter speculative land holding and promote efficient\nuse of valuable resources. Adherents argue that because the supply of land is fundamentally inelastic,\ntaxing it will not deter its availability or use, unlike other forms of taxation. Georgism differs\nfrom Marxism and capitalism, underscoring the distinction between common and private property while\nlargely contending that individuals should own the fruits of their labor.&#34;&#34;&#34;\nquery = f&#34;The best academic source about {paragraph} is (paper: &#34;\ngeorgism_search_response = exa.search_and_contents(paragraph, highlights=highlights_options, num_results=5, use_autoprompt=False)\n  \n  for result in georgism_search_response.results:\nprint(result.title)\nprint(result.url)\npprint(result.highlights)\n  \n Henry George\nhttps://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Henry_George\n[&#34;George&#39;s theory of interest is nowadays dismissed even by some otherwise &#34;\n&#39;Georgist authors, who see it as mistaken and irrelevant to his ideas about &#39;\n&#39;land and free trade. The separation of the value of land into improved and &#39;\n&#34;unimproved is problematic in George&#39;s theory. Once construction has taken &#34;\n&#39;place, not only the land on which such improvements were made is affected, &#39;\n&#39;the value of neighboring, as yet unimproved, land is impacted. Thus, while &#39;\n&#39;the construction of a major attraction nearby may increase the value of &#39;\n&#39;land, the construction of factories or nuclear power plants decreases its &#39;\n&#39;value. Indeed, location is the single most important asset in real estate. &#39;\n&#39;George intended to propose a tax that would have the least negative impact &#39;\n&#39;on productive activity. However, even unimproved land turns out to be &#39;\n&#39;affected in value by productive activity in the neighborhood.&#39;]\nWikiwand\nhttps://www.wikiwand.com/en/Georgism\n[&#39;Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by land &#39;\n&#39;ownership, natural monopolies, pollution rights, and control of the commons, &#39;\n&#39;including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived &#39;\n&#39;privileges (e.g. intellectual property). Any natural resource which is &#39;\n&#39;inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical &#39;\n&#39;and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of &#39;\n&#39;common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that &#39;\n&#39;taxing economic rent is efficient, fair and equitable. The main Georgist &#39;\n&#39;policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value, arguing that revenues &#39;\n&#39;from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing &#39;\n&#39;taxes (such as on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and &#39;\n&#39;inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public &#39;\n&#34;revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#39;s dividend. The &#34;\n&#39;concept of gaining public revenues mainly from land and natural resource &#39;\n&#39;privileges was widely popularized by Henry George through his first book, &#39;\n&#39;Progress and Poverty (1879).&#39;]\nHenry George\nhttps://www.conservapedia.com/Henry_George\n[&#39;He argued that land, unlike other factors of production, is supplied by &#39;\n&#39;nature and that rent is unearned surplus. The landless deserve their share &#39;\n&#39;of this surplus as a birthright, according to George. Henry George was born &#39;\n&#39;in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the 2nd of September 1839. He settled in &#39;\n&#39;California in 1858; then later removed to New York in 1880; was first a &#39;\n&#39;printer, then an editor, but finally devoted all his life to economic and &#39;\n&#39;social questions. In 1860, George met Annie Corsina Fox. Her family was very &#39;\n&#39;opposed to the relationship, and in 1861 they eloped. In 1871 he published &#39;\n&#39;Our Land Policy, which, as further developed in 1879 under the title of &#39;\n&#39;Progress and Poverty, speedily attracted the widest attention both in &#39;\n&#39;America and in Europe.&#39;]\nGeorgism - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism\n[&#39;A key issue to the popular adoption of Georgism is that homes are illiquid &#39;\n&#39;yet governments need cash every year. Some economists have proposed other &#39;\n&#39;ways of extracting value from land such as building government housing and &#39;\n&#39;selling homes to new buyers in areas of fast-rising land value. The &#39;\n&#39;government would theoretically collect revenue from home sales without much &#39;\n&#39;cost to current homeowners while slowing down land value appreciation in &#39;\n&#39;high-demand areas. Henry George, whose writings and advocacy form the basis &#39;\n&#39;for Georgism Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early &#39;\n&#39;20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas &#39;\n&#39;include the Commonwealth Land Party in the United States, the Henry George &#39;\n&#39;Justice Party in Victoria, the Single Tax League in South Australia, and the &#39;\n&#34;Justice Party in Denmark. In the United Kingdom, George&#39;s writings were &#34;\n&#39;praised by emerging socialist groups in 1890s such as the Independent Labour &#39;\n&#39;Party and the Fabian Society, which would each go on to help form the &#39;\n&#39;modern-day Labour Party.&#39;]\nGeorgism\nhttps://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Georgism\n[&#39;Even with mostly primitive methods, land values are already assessed around &#39;\n&#39;the world wherever property/council taxes exist, and some municipalities &#39;\n&#39;even collect all their revenue from land values. Though these are &#39;\n&#39;market-based measures, they can still prove difficult and require upfront &#39;\n&#39;investment. Georgists believe that the potential value of land is greater &#39;\n&#39;than the current sum of government spending, since the abolition of taxes on &#39;\n&#39;labor and investment would further increase the value of land. Conversely, &#39;\n&#39;the libertarian strain in Georgism is evident in the notion that their land &#39;\n&#39;tax utopia also entails reducing or eliminating the need for many of the &#39;\n&#39;things governments currently supply, such as welfare, infrastructure to &#39;\n&#39;support urban sprawl, and military &amp; foreign aid spending to secure &#39;\n&#34;resources abroad. Therefore, many Georgists propose a citizen&#39;s dividend. &#34;\n&#39;This is a similar concept to basic income but its proponents project its &#39;\n&#39;potential to be much larger due to supposedly huge takings from the land &#39;\n&#39;tax, combined with lowered government spending. It has been recognized since &#39;\n&#39;Adam Smith and David Ricardo that a tax on land value itself cannot be &#39;\n&#39;passed on to tenants, but instead would be paid for by the owners of the &#39;\n&#39;land:&#39;]\n \nUsing Exa, we can easily find related papers, either for further research or to provide a source for our claims.

This enables us to filter the\ninternet by meaning, not by keyword. Here's the same search on Exa:  startups working on climate change   Rewind Climate Change https://www.rewind.earth/ Stored on the bottom of the sea, the carbon will be sequestered for thousands of years.     Holocene ‚Äî Harnessing organic chemistry to remove CO2 https://www.theholocene.co/  Harnessing organic chemistry to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere, forever.     A NOVEL PHOTOCHEMICAL PROCESS TO CAPTURE CARBON DIOXIDE https://www.banyucarbon.com/ Combined they have &gt;130 peer-reviewed publications, have managed research projects worth millions of dollars, and have both presented before the National Academies of Science.     Living Carbon https://www.livingcarbon.com/  Restoring ecosystems from the ground up More biomass and faster growth means more carbon capture Our trees accumulate up to 53% more biomass than control seedlings We incorporated a photosynthesis enhancement trait to help trees grow faster We√¢¬Ä¬ôve developed a metal accumulation trait so trees can absorb more metals in their roots and stem These metals naturally slow wood decay, creating durable wood products and retaining carbon in wood for a longer period of time Our trees are unique in their ability to grow on degraded land with high concentrations of heavy metals As our trees grow, they can clean soil made toxic by industrial activity, store more carbon, and create investment opportunities on otherwise abandoned land      Phykos, PBC https://www.phykos.co/ We've built houses and farms and families, and we've travelled widely to see firsthand just how precious this world is.     Eion Carbon | Carbon removal that checks all the right boxes https://eioncarbon.com/ For every 10,000 tons of carbon removal, we create about five local jobs.     Climate Robotics https://www.climaterobotics.com/ In order to save ourselves from catastrophic climate change, we must automate sequestering carbon as well.     Carbon Dioxide Removal | Carba https://www.carba.com/ When biomass biodegrades, up to half of the carbon can be converted into methane, which carries 28 times the greenhouse warming potential.     Unemit https://unemit.com/ We firmly believe humanity can and will reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, and ours will be a significant contribution to stopping and then reversing climate change by driving permanent Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) of more than 10% of historical emissions by the end of the century.\t     Twelve | The Carbon Transformation Company https://www.twelve.co/ To get there, we are working with brands and industrial partners to implement our technology at scale and eliminate emissions from global manufacturing supply chains.     Note that these results don't necessarily mention the words \"climate change\" or \"startup\". Exa\nfiltered out all the noisy webpages ‚Äì the listicles talking about startups ‚Äì and returned the\nactual knowledge ‚Äì the startups themselves. Exa's goal is to understand any query ‚Äì no matter how complex ‚Äì and filter the internet to\nexactly the knowledge required for that query. This is the solution to the problem of overwhelming information. Instead of 40 million\nnoisy/redundant links, we‚Äôll filter down to exactly the pieces of knowledge needed. In doing\nso, we‚Äôll convert an internet landfill into a library of knowledge with each and every search. That's why we chose the name Exa. Exa means 10^18th power. Google means 10^100th power. While\nGoogle aims to surface all information, Exa aims to filter all information into organized\nknowledge. And when it comes to organized knowledge, 10^18 is greater than 10^100. Why .ai? It just so happens that a creature recently emerged on this planet with a particularly strong\nneed for organized, high quality knowledge. AIs, powered by LLMs like ChatGPT, are overhauling the way we do knowledge work. But to\nperform knowledge work optimally, AIs must incorporate the internet‚Äôs knowledge. That means\nthey need to be paired with a web retrieval system, like Exa. The quality of web retrieval particularly matters for LLMs. If retrieval returns junk\ninformation, the LLM will output junk content. If the retrieval is powerful enough to filter\nthe internet to the right knowledge, the LLM will output the highest quality content possible. Most of our customers have tried search APIs like Bing and Google SERP. They come to us\nbecause those APIs just don‚Äôt work for their use cases. Those APIs work for humans, but not\nfor LLMs, which have quite different needs. We‚Äôve been on the frontlines witnessing this transformation of knowledge work and of\nretrieval. We believe AI applications will soon search the internet more than humans. That‚Äôs why Exa wasn‚Äôt just built with AI, it was also built for AI. Building with the Exa API Exa was designed with all the features necessary for AI applications:  Filter out noisy SEO results to only the type of content the AI requests Handle long queries ‚Äì a sentence, a paragraph, or even a whole webpage can be a query Retrieve the page content of any url for downstream processing  Today we're adding highlights. Highlights means Exa can instantly extract any\npiece of content from any result's webpage. Behind the scenes, we‚Äôre chunking and embedding\nfull webpages with a paragraph prediction model. Because this happens live, you can customize\nhighlights length, # per page, and specify a secondary query specific to what content you want\nto find. Customers using highlights have seen significant increases in user conversion compared to Bing\nand other search providers. It's exciting to see customers using Exa for so many applications that just weren't possible a\nyear ago, from research paper writing assistants, to lead generation research bots, to\nlearning tools for students. A mission we take seriously As builders at the doorway to the world‚Äôs knowledge, we recognize the power we wield. The\nknowledge people consume underlies nearly everything, from our politics to our scientific\nprogress to our daily perceptions of the world. We believe that organizing the world's knowledge, and thereby giving users immense power to\nfilter the internet, is critical societal infrastructure that does not currently exist. Luckily, our incentives are aligned with our values. We have no ad-based need to monetize\nattention. Our API customers want the highest quality search possible. So do we. When the\ninternet feels like a library of all knowledge, we'll know we succeeded. If you want to help us build some of the coolest technology ‚Äì designing internet-scale web\ncrawling infrastructure, training foundation models for search on our own GPU cluster, serving\ncustom vector databases at scale ‚Äì you can check out our roles here. And if you're ready to build with the Exa API, you can sign up here. Thanks for reading and we'll keep writing more posts soon so you can join us on the ride!  See more",

3.  **Blog Content**: Gather recent blog posts:

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```
results = exa.get_contents(["https://medium.com"], subpages=5, subpage_target=["blog", "articles"], livecrawl='always')
```

## 

[‚Äã

](#best-practices)

Best Practices

1.  **Limit Depth**: Start with a smaller `subpages` value (5-10) and increase if needed
2.  **Consider Caching**: Use `livecrawl='always'` only when you need the most recent content
3.  **Target Specific Sections**: Use `subpage_target` to focus on relevant sections rather than crawling the entire site

## 

[‚Äã

](#combining-with-livecrawl)

Combining with LiveCrawl

For the most up-to-date and comprehensive results, combine subpage crawling with livecrawl:

Python

Copy

Ask AI

```
result = exa.get_contents(
  ["https://www.apple.com/"],
  livecrawl="always",
  subpage_target=["news", "product"],
  subpages=10
)
```

This ensures you get fresh content from all discovered subpages.

Note that regarding usage, additional subpages count as an additional piece of content retrieval for each type you specify.
